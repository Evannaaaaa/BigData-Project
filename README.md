# BigData-Project
Bank Account Fraud Analysis and Predictive Modeling

•	Leveraged AWS cloud computing capabilities to process a large Kaggle dataset comprising 1 million instances, setting the groundwork for a scalable and robust big data analytics framework.  
•	Applied advanced predictive modeling techniques, including Logistic Regression, Classification Trees, and Neural Networks, to tackle the complexities of bank fraud detection. Utilized SMOTE and SPSS oversampling techniques to balance the dataset.  
•	Achieved superior performance with the Neural Network model, boasting an impressive ROC-AUC score of 0.8984, thereby demonstrating the model's effectiveness in distinguishing fraudulent from non-fraudulent activities.  
•	Isolated crucial predictive variables, such as 'housing_status,' 'phone_home_valid,' and 'date_of_birth_distinct_emails_4w,' allowing for more nuanced and accurate fraud detection in future applications.
